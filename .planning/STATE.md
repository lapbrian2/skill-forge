# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-20)

**Core value:** User describes an idea in one paragraph and gets back a complete engineering spec they can paste into Claude Code and have it build -- no ambiguity, no guessing.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: LLM Infrastructure

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4-phase structure -- LLM infra, discovery, spec gen+output, validation+dashboard+polish
- [Roadmap]: Spec generation and output merged into single phase (natural delivery boundary)
- [Roadmap]: Validation, dashboard, and UX polish merged into single phase (all post-core-loop work)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY must be configured in Vercel env vars before any LLM features work in production
- Suggest-then-confirm prompt engineering is the product's core differentiator -- needs careful iteration in Phase 2
